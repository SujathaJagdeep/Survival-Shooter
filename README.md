Description of the Survival Shooter Project
Survival Shooter is a First Person Shooter (FPS) game. It is based on the theme of a young boy (yourself) having a dream that all of his toys have come to life. So, you run around to shoot all of your scary toys such as Zombears, Zombunnys, and Helephants in order to survive. You score points whenever you shoot a toy. However, your toys also attack you during the shooting. Hence, you lose your health and eventually die.
