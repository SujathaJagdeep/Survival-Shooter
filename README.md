## Versions

### Description of the Maze Project 
Survival Shooter is an isometric shooter game. The theme revolves around a young boy (yourself) who has a dream that all of his toys have come to life. You run around and shoot your toys such as the Zombunnys, Zombears, and Hellephants. You score points whenever you shoot a toy. However, the toys also attack you during the shooting. You gradually lose your health that is visible on the health slider and eventually die.


### My Reflection and Conclusion
- I worked to ensure that the project meets all the specifications.
- I love working in Unity 3D, as I have keen interest to learn using it inside out. Therefore, I liked almost everything about the project.
- I really enjoy the fact that I was able to practice my hands-on skills with using Unity3D and learn a lot of C# coding tricks while completing the project.
- I plan to configure the project to run on Oculus Quest during January 2020.
